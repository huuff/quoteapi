# Task
* Add at least 10 quotes (hardcoded)
* Show a countdown for next refresh in the debug window
* Use sentiment analysis to set a background according to the emotion of the quote
* Test it
* An alert with an error when a request is unsuccessful
* Separate the actions bar in `TheQuoteBox.vue` from the rest of the quote box? UPDATE: Use a slot for extra card content, and put the actions in that slot.
